This open source GPT UI is meant to be a combination of chatgpt and coding REPLs. Idea is to foster creativity by enabling better exploratory programming, learning, etc. Try it out at https://chatcraft.org

Features:

- previews of HTML and mermaid diagrams.
- Deletion of messages, single-message mode. easy switching between chatgpt3.5/gpt-4 model to make it easier to coax desired responses
- fully-clientside UI, openai key storage, message history. This enables for easier exploration of various concepts, adding features for particular modes of interaction, etc without having to worry about serverside
- vite builds, for super-fast iteration
- Good chunk of the initial code was written using the tool itself ;)

Desired features:

- sidebar for switching llm params
- cancelling of streaming messages ala chatgpt
- New modes of interaction, eg integration with jsfiddle-like workflows, JS/TS REPL
- Social features: eg I should be able to write a blog post about obscure topic like "LLM-assisted formal methods for program checking" and link to a sample convo from my blog. users could jump in and start exploring that space.
- Editing responses from GPT, to get better followup responses for when gpt is almost correct
- more LLM models, easier ways to adjust LLM settings
- allow the UI to be used as a debugging tool to trace various gpt frotnends (eg langchain.js agents)
- voice? phone? chatgpt-plugins?
